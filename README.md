## To Lavanya:
- using iphone12 (ios simulator)
- please run both npm install and expo install
- starting page is in App.js
- Main User details are: email: User1@email.com | password: Password

If you are finding errors it is most likely cause expo is saving the state so please just reset the current simulator (this is due to user authentication being in use)

## To Team:
