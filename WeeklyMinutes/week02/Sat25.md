# Agile Processes and Work Structure

The team plan to follow the agile process of SCRUM to succeed in the project. 

![Scrum Skeleton](resources/scrumProcess.jpeg)

There are planned to be small daily meetings, which are to be carried out in text on MSTeams, with continuous pair-programming with the team. This was decided, due to the experience of the lead and the comfortability of the team in achieving the project goals with such a process due to previous experience. 

The stand-up meetings are increased, in the number of times in a week, compared to a typical agile process, due to the fact that none of the team members can commit full-time to the project and the time of the project itself.

A timetable was created with 4 major meetings planned out evenly through the week [one including the designated tutorial period]. This was done to ensure consistency throughout the team especially as the team is not able to meet in person and can only do online meetings. 

It also allows the team to complete work hence making use of the mentors’ time as they can ask relevant questions to the Mentor, as well as hold themselves individually and the team itself accountable for their contribution. The team timetable is as follows:

    Note that extra hours are reserved in-case there is a need for further hours of work with the team.

# Team Contract, Assigning roles and Rotation roster for meeting minutes

## Team Name: 
    Group02
 
## Team Members and their roles:
The hierarchy is made to split up the responsibility of the project and create a structure to solve problems that may arise in the team and the work, with the mentor being the highest level of authorisation. 

We made an overall lead, the **Project Lead**, to monitor the project as a whole along with the documents/work for submission, and the **Meeting Minutes Officer** to take care of most of the theory. A **GitLab Repository Lead** that monitors the repository of the team and the software decisions. Then a **Issues Board Lead** to monitor the user stories and progress of the team - hence giving a high-quality end result for each part of the project.

For the decision making process we will work as a team to solve any issue however if not possible the hierarchy of the leads will cause Manpreet to take the decision and then if not possible then the mentor (a third party) would have to step in.
